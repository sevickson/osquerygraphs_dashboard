By selecting the *Operating System* you are interested in, the dashboard automatically downloads the data and creates the corresponding graph.  
When loaded you can use __Show Osquery tables with connections__ to select the tables you are interested in.  

The option __Show connected Osquery table columns with different names__ gives you with 1-click all the columns that are directly connected but have different names. This can possibly show naming inconsistencies.

With ⚙ __Graph Options__ you can dig in further.
* *Disperse Graph* Pulls the graph out of the rings and re-clusters it based on degree of connections. 💥
* *Dark Mode* Is just Dark Mode. ⚫
* *Expert Mode* Opens up the menu and other Graphistry options to give you the possibility to take control of the rendering. 🧐

And `Why Not❕🎈` is just why not... 😁

__📃 Data Explorer 📃__, is used for data analysis based on the tables that are selected.   
*Percent_Join* column in the *Selected Osquery tables* is especially interesting as it shows, based on all the data gathered, how ‘Join-able’ that table column is, let’s call it the __Join probability__.

__🚫 Table/Column Exclusions__ is jsut a searchbar you can easily use to find out which tables have been excluded from the graph.
