Untangling the Osquery❓ tables 🕸 using Data📜 | Part 2

This journey is to answer the following research question.
How can I visualize the relationship between Osquery tables, for data enrichment?
My personal motivation for wanting to answer this question is that visualization of the connection between Osquery Tables can help to understand the possibilities and help me and you!
This is even more evident in Security Incidents where time is short and you want to enrich your data and gather the most evidence possible and when for example you are Threat Hunting and you want to pivot to another table based on retrieved data, you would want a way to easily figure out which Osquery Tables you can pivot to from the table you are at that moment.
